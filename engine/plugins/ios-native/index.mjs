/**
 * `ctx.iosNative` — the same path the engine's own tools take.
 *
 * **For the agent. Not an API, and not aimed at plugins** (§1.1): a plugin
 * calling the device capabilities is out of scope for now — the security model
 * is not worked out and the value case is not there. If that changes it means a
 * versioned API protocol of its own, which is a different piece of work.
 *
 * A third-party plugin can reach it anyway, and reach the addon underneath it,
 * and nothing here can stop that (§5.3.1 — measured: a plugin writes one
 * `new Worker(code, {eval: true})` and has a fresh realm with its own
 * `process`, both binding handles intact). Saying "plugins may not" would be a
 * promise we cannot keep. What we can say is that nothing is promised to them:
 * capability names, operation names and argument shapes change with the app and
 * nothing here is versioned. The agent keeps up because it re-reads the skill
 * file; a plugin that wrote these names down would break on an update.
 *
 * It stays exposed anyway, rather than being hidden to discourage use, because
 * hiding it would not close anything — it would only push an honest plugin onto
 * the unnamed path, where cordis cannot read its name and the activity list
 * shows the caller as unknown. That makes the audit worse, not better.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a per-caller gate: a plugin can reach the addon directly
 * (`process._linkedBinding`), and could present itself as the engine itself by
 * calling through `ctx.root`, so a check here would only stop the plugins that
 * were not trying to get around it. The checks that hold are iOS's own
 * permission prompts and, for writes, the confirmation the addon runs on the
 * main thread (docs/native-services.md §2.2, §5.3).
