name: ios-environment
description: This session runs inside an iOS app, not on a desktop, and many commands do not exist. Load this skill before relying on a shell command you are unsure of, whenever one fails or behaves unexpectedly, and before writing or changing a DSH plugin, because the app's native interface does not run a plugin's browser code.

# Working on iOS

You are running inside an iOS app. iOS allows no child processes, so nothing here is a real Unix system: `bash` is an emulator written in JavaScript, and every command below runs inside the app. Your own tools (read, write, edit, search) work normally. This page is about the shell, and what the app can show of a DSH plugin.

Check here before improvising, and do not retry a command this page says is missing. Installing it will not work either: there is no `apt`, `brew`, or `sudo`, and iOS refuses to run downloaded binaries.

## Commands that exist

Anything not listed here should be assumed missing.

- **Files:** `ls cat cp mv rm mkdir rmdir touch ln chmod stat file du tree find readlink basename dirname mktemp`
- **Text:** `grep egrep fgrep rg sed awk cut sort uniq wc head tail tr tee paste join comm column fold expand unexpand nl rev tac seq printf echo strings od diff split`
- **Data:** `jq yq xan html-to-markdown base64 md5sum sha1sum sha256sum`
- **Archives:** `tar gzip gunzip zcat`
- **Network:** `curl`
- **Development:** `git node pnpm pnpx`
- **Shell:** `bash sh env printenv which type command date sleep timeout time xargs yes true false expr whoami hostname pwd history alias unalias clear help`

Python and pip also exist: see the Python section below.

## Missing, and what to do instead

| Missing | Use instead |
|---|---|
| `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `corepack` | `pnpm`, `pnpx` |
| `bun`, `deno` | `node` |
| `tsc`, `tsx` | `node file.ts` runs TypeScript directly. For a real compile, `pnpm add -D typescript@5` and run `node_modules/.bin/tsc`. TypeScript 7 is native and does not run |
| `ruby`, `perl`, `php`, `lua` | Write the script in Node or Python |
| `gcc`, `clang`, `make`, `cmake`, `cargo`, `go`, `java`, `swift` | Nothing compiles here. Say so, and leave the build to another machine |
| `zip`, `unzip`, `7z`, `xz`, `bzip2` | `tar` and `gzip`, or an npm package such as `fflate` |
| `wget` | `curl` |
| `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync`, `nc`, `ping` | `curl` for HTTP(S). There is no other way to reach a remote machine |
| `uname` | `node -p "process.platform + ' ' + process.arch"` |
| `ps`, `kill`, `killall`, `jobs`, `nohup`, `top`, `lsof`, `df`, `free`, `id` | No equivalent: there is no process table. `timeout <seconds> <command>` bounds a command you are unsure will finish |
| `vim`, `nano`, `less`, `man` | Your file tools for editing; `head` and `sed -n` for reading; `<command> --help` for usage |
| `gh`, `docker` | The GitHub REST API through `curl`. Containers are not possible |
| `sudo`, `su`, `chown`, `apt`, `brew` | Not possible and not needed: you own everything you can write to |
| `sqlite3` | Exists but fails on iOS. Use `node:sqlite` from Node |

## Shell behaviour

Pipes, redirects, `&&`, `||`, variables, arrays, functions, loops, here-documents, `$(...)`, subshells and `[[ ]]` work. Plain bash scripts run. The differences that matter:

- **No live output.** A command's output appears only when it finishes. A single `node`, `pnpm run` or `python3` command is the exception and streams.
- **Nothing is interactive.** There is no TTY. Commands that prompt or open an editor fail or wait forever: pass flags that avoid the prompt.
- **`trap` does nothing.** It is accepted, but no signal arrives and `EXIT` traps do not run. Do not rely on them for cleanup.
- **Heavy shell work blocks the app.** The interpreter shares a thread with the agent. Long `while` loops or a big `sort` or `rg` freeze everything until they finish. Do heavy work in a Node script: it runs on its own thread.
- **`&` does not detach.** The shell returns only after background jobs finish, so `server & curl localhost` still waits for `server`, and nothing survives the command. `wait` works.
- **Run scripts with their interpreter.** `./tool.js` works only as a whole command on its own: in `./tool.js && next`, or in a pipe, the shell tries to parse it as bash and fails. Write `node tool.js`. The same goes for `./tool.py`: write `python3 tool.py`. Scripts in other languages do not run.
- **`xargs` is limited.** `xargs -n 1 cmd` works (with the space); `-n1` and `-I{}` do not. Use a `for` loop when you need placeholders.
- **Reduced file metadata.** `ls -l` may show placeholder owners and dates.
- **`/dev` is only `/dev/null` in the shell.** `> /dev/null` works, but `/dev/urandom` and other devices do not exist there. Use `node:crypto` for random bytes.

## Files

- `$HOME` is `/home/dsh` and `$TMPDIR` is `/tmp`. Both are private to the app and writable, and these paths never change, so they are safe to store.
- The first-use workspace is under `~/Documents`. Workspaces are not visible in the Files app.
- `/` is the app's own tree: `home`, `tmp`, `opt`, plus anything you create. Writing to `/abc` or `/usr/local` works and stays inside the app.
- `/etc`, `/usr/share` and `/System` are the real system and read-only. `/opt/dsh` is the app itself and read-only.
- `/bin` and `/usr/bin` exist only in the shell, for its commands. A Node script does not see them.

## Node

Node 24 runs in jitless mode: pure JavaScript is several times slower than on a desktop, and most work is unaffected.

- `child_process` works, but it reaches this same emulated shell. Only the commands on this page can be spawned.
- `http.createServer` works, and dev servers listen on `127.0.0.1`.
- WebAssembly works but runs interpreted, so wasm tools are slow.
- A plain `node` script can use the filesystem, network, `node:sqlite` and worker threads, and `node file.ts` runs TypeScript.

## Python

Python 3.15 is built into the app: `python`, `python3`, `python3.15`, `pip`, `pip3` and `pip3.15` work, and so do `#!/usr/bin/env python3` scripts run as a whole command. Pure Python runs close to desktop speed. The standard library is complete apart from GUI modules: `sqlite3`, `ssl`, `threading`, `asyncio` and `venv` all work.

- `pip install` works for pure-Python packages. Outside a venv they go to `~/.local`. The first `pip` sets pip itself up, which takes a few seconds.
- `python3 -m venv .venv` works, and so does `source .venv/bin/activate` (for that one command, or for the rest of a terminal session). Its `bin/python`, `bin/pip` and the commands pip installs (`bin/black`, `bin/pytest`…) run anywhere in a command line.
- **Packages with compiled extensions do not work**: `numpy`, `pandas`, `Pillow`, `lxml`, `torch`, `cryptography` and the like. pip fails to build them, or they fail to import. Say so instead of retrying, and look for a pure-Python alternative.
- **`subprocess` runs only Python.** From Python, `subprocess.run([sys.executable, …])` and `python3 …` work; any other program (`git`, `ls`, a shell) raises `FileNotFoundError`. So does `multiprocessing`. Use Python's own modules (`shutil`, `pathlib`, `glob`) instead of shelling out.
- **No interactive Python.** `python3` with no script reads its program from stdin; there is no prompt, and `input()` gets only what was piped in.
- `uv`, `poetry` and `conda` are native programs and do not exist: use `pip` and `venv`.

## Packages

- `pnpm add`, `pnpm install`, `pnpm run` and `pnpx` work, and pure JavaScript packages are fine. `pnpm add` creates `package.json` if there is none.
- **Do not run `pnpm init`, and remove a `packageManager` field.** With that field in `package.json` every pnpm command fails with "ships no native binary for ios-arm64". `pnpm init` writes it, and many projects already have it. Delete the field (tell the user you did), and pnpm works again.
- **Packages with native binaries do not work.** Anything shipping a `.node` addon or a platform executable (`esbuild`, `sharp`, `better-sqlite3`, `swc`, Turbopack, TypeScript 7) installs but fails when used, typically with "Unsupported platform: ios arm64". Say so instead of retrying. Next.js needs `next dev --webpack`; `esbuild-wasm` does not work either, because it needs a child process.
- **A DSH plugin's Host code gets a partial `sharp`.** Inside the engine `sharp` is a stand-in over iOS's ImageIO: `metadata()`, `rotate()` with no arguments, `resize({ width, height, fit: 'inside', withoutEnlargement })`, `toColourspace('srgb')`, `jpeg({ quality })`, `raw()`, `clone()` and `toBuffer()`, on Buffer input. Anything else, including WebP and PNG output, throws `sharp: … is not supported on iOS`. It reports `hasAlpha: false` for every image and flattens transparency onto white. A plain `node` script does not get it.
- Install scripts do not run. `pnpm` may print `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` afterwards: the package is still installed.

## DSH plugins

The app has two interfaces onto the same engine and profile. The user normally works in the **native interface**, built in SwiftUI. The **web interface** is the official DSH Web UI, opened from Settings → 网页版. A plugin does not reach both in the same way:

| Part of a plugin | Native interface | Web interface |
|---|---|---|
| Host half: what runs in the engine, such as tools and settings | Works | Works |
| Browser half: `dsh.client` in `package.json`, the `./client` export, slots such as `sidebar.panellist` and `main`, React pages and panels | **Never runs** | Works |

- **A plugin that only adds interface is invisible in the native interface.** No sidebar entry, panel, or custom page appears there. Its card still shows under 插件 as installed and running, because the engine did load it.
- **The built-in DS Bot plugin (`ds-bot`) is the exception.** The app ships it pinned to one version and draws its Bots, group chats, schedules and forms in native pages (the Bot card in the sidebar). Its own web page is not needed there, and it cannot be updated or replaced from the app.
- **Say this before building it.** If the user asks for something they will see, tell them first that a browser half appears only under Settings → 网页版. If it must work in the native interface, put the feature in the Host half instead: a tool the agent can call.
- **Report where it appears.** Being in the profile, loading in the engine, or working in a web page does not show that it appears in the native interface. Name the interface you checked, and do not say a plugin's interface is in the app without saying it is the web interface.
- **`localStorage` belongs to the web interface.** Data a browser half keeps there never reaches the engine or the native interface.
- **Dynamic Cordis plugins** with Client code cannot be activated from the native interface. Define a Host-only version, or run it from the web interface.
- **Device capabilities are for you, not for plugins.** Building a plugin on them is out of scope — do not do it and do not offer to, even if the user's idea would work. Say why if they ask: nothing is promised here, the names and arguments change between versions, and a plugin that wrote them down breaks silently on an update. You are fine because you re-read this file every session.
- **A plugin they install can still reach them**, and nothing stops that: whatever the app is allowed to do, a plugin they install is allowed to do. That is a fact about installing plugins, so say it plainly when you build one for them — it is the reason the install warning reads the way it does.

## git

`git` is built in, on libgit2. Its output matches real git, so read it as usual.

**Works:** `init clone fetch pull push status add rm mv commit log show diff rev-list shortlog diff-tree branch checkout switch restore reset merge tag stash clean apply remote ls-remote worktree config rev-parse ls-files ls-tree cat-file write-tree check-ignore hash-object merge-base show-ref symbolic-ref check-ref-format whatchanged`

**Not available:**

| Command | Use instead |
|---|---|
| `rebase` | `git merge`, or `git pull --no-rebase` |
| squashing history | `git reset --soft <base>`, then `git commit` |
| `cherry-pick` | `git diff <commit>~1 <commit> \| git apply --index`, then `git commit` |
| `revert` | Undo the change in the files and commit |
| `blame` | `git log -p -- <file>` |
| `git grep` | `rg` |
| `bisect`, `submodule`, `am`, `format-patch`, `reflog`, `describe`, `notes`, `sparse-checkout`, `filter-branch`, `lfs` | Not available |

**Rules:**

- Always pass `-m` or `-F` to `commit` and `tag -a`: there is no editor. `commit --amend` and `--no-edit` reuse the existing message, and concluding a merge reuses `MERGE_MSG`.
- Nothing interactive: no `add -p`, `rebase -i`, or `checkout -p`.
- Remotes are **HTTPS only**. Rewrite `git@github.com:a/b.git` as `https://github.com/a/b.git`. SSH cannot work here.
- Set an identity before the first commit: `git config --global user.name "…"` and `user.email`.
- For private repositories, credentials come from the URL, from `~/.git-credentials` (`https://user:token@host` lines), or from `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` for github.com. Nothing prompts for them.
- `log --graph` draws a single column, and no branch lines. Submodules are not cloned.
- Large clones take a while and print nothing until they finish.

## Device capabilities

You have tools onto the phone itself. They are not shell commands — there is no `apple-*` binary to run, and the shell cannot reach any of this.

| Tool | What it does | Worth knowing |
|---|---|---|
| `device_info` | Model, iOS version, battery, low power mode, thermal state, free storage | Read it before long or storage-hungry work. Low power mode and a `serious`/`critical` thermal state are good reasons to stop and say so |
| `notify` | Schedule, list and cancel local notifications | This is the right answer to "remind me in 20 minutes": it alerts the user with the app closed. Needs the user to switch notifications on under Device capabilities first; until then it refuses, and the refusal says so |
| `open_url` | Hand a URL to the app that owns it: maps, a draft email or text, the dialler, the App Store, a web page | Use it when they asked to be taken somewhere. To merely offer a link, write a Markdown link instead — that works for any scheme and leaves the tap to them. Only a few schemes are allowed through; the refusal names them |
| `text_analysis` | Rank strings by meaning (`similar`), identify a language, pull out names and places | `similar` is the one that does something you cannot: it needs embedding vectors, so use it to narrow hundreds of file names or titles down to a handful worth opening. It returns an ORDER, not a score — the top few are candidates to check, and a low number does not mean "not relevant". `language` and `entities` are for bulk only: on text you can see, your own reading is better |
| `maps` | Find places; travel time and turn-by-turn between two coordinates | No permission and it never reads where the user is — "near me" needs `location` first. **`eta` and `route` take coordinates, not names**: run `search` or `location geocode`, look at what came back, pick the one they meant, then route. Two calls on purpose — a geocoder answers *something* even when it has never heard of the place, and you will spot that its answer is in the wrong country while a route between two wrong points just looks like a short trip |
| `read_image` | Text (OCR), barcodes, what a picture is of, how many faces | On device; the picture is never uploaded. Prefer it over attaching an image when you only need the text out of it. It reads only files the engine can see. Faces are counted, never identified. `classify` returns labels with their raw confidences and no threshold — most of them score near zero, and deciding which ones matter for this image is yours |
| `clipboard` | Read, replace or empty what they copied | Reading raises a banner naming this app, every time. Only reach for it when they meant the clipboard — never to see whether it might be useful |
| `location` | Where the phone is; addresses ↔ coordinates | One reading at a time, only while the app is open; no tracking, no history. `geocode` and `reverse` cost no privacy at all, so prefer them when the question is about a place rather than about the user. They return **every** candidate rather than a best guess — read the list and say which one you used |
| `speak` | Read text aloud with the system voices | Returns when speech *starts*, not when it ends. Pass `language` when the text is not in the device language, or an English voice may read Chinese. Ending your turn does not stop the audio |
| `calendar` | Read their events, and add, change or delete one | Reading defaults to the next 7 days; pass `from`/`to` as `YYYY-MM-DD` for anything else. Changing or deleting takes the event's `id`, which every `list` line ends with — list first. Writes go straight through unless they set otherwise — see **Writes** below |
| `reminders` | Read their Reminders, and add one, mark one done, or delete one | Same write rules as the calendar, and the same `id` from `list` (or from the `create` that made it) to mark one done or delete it. A reminder with no `due` never alerts — it is just a line on a list |
| `transcribe_audio` | Read what is said in an audio file on this device: a voice memo, a recorded meeting | On device by default, so nothing is uploaded and it costs no tokens — prefer it over attaching the audio. It reads a **file**: it does not listen to the microphone and cannot record, so do not offer live dictation. `text` is Apple's best reading and the others are in `alternatives` — look there when a word makes no sense in context |
| `health` | Read Apple Health: activity, heart, sleep, body measurements and more | **Read-only** — nothing here writes to Health. Call `types` first for what can be read and in which unit. Prefer `aggregate` for anything about activity: raw samples from an iPhone and a Watch overlap, so adding them up double counts. iOS never says whether a read was allowed, so an empty answer means **either** that type was not allowed **or** nothing is recorded. Say it could be either; never "you have no data" and never "access is off" |
| `photos` | Read photo and video metadata, list albums, export one photo to a file | No image data comes back: find the picture with `list` or `albums`, `export` it, then `read_image` the path — all on the phone. Order is **oldest first**, so pass `from`/`to` or `newestFirst` for recent pictures. `access: "limited"` means they shared a few photos, not their library: say that instead of telling them how many photos they have. It cannot add, edit or delete |
| `homekit` | List homes, rooms, accessories and scenes; read one accessory; write one characteristic; run a scene | Values are HomeKit's own and are not translated: read a characteristic's `type` and its `metadata` (format, minimum, maximum, units) to know what a number means. When a name matches several accessories or scenes, `get` returns them all while `set` and `trigger` refuse and list them — pick one and pass its `uniqueIdentifier`. Writes follow **Writes** below |
| `alarm` | Set a real alarm clock; list and cancel the ones you set | It breaks through silent mode and Focus and rings until they stop it — only for things they must not miss; use `notify` for ordinary reminders. Needs iOS 26 or later |
| `contacts` | Look someone up in their address book by name, phone or email; read one card in full | Read-only: it cannot add, edit or delete a contact, and it sends nothing — it only gets you the number or address for the next step. `search` takes exactly **one** of `name` / `phone` / `email`, and you say which; it will not work out what kind of query you passed. A name matches from the start of a word ("bell" finds Kate Bell, "ate" does not); a phone number or an email has to be the **whole** one — part of it matches nothing, so an empty answer for a fragment does not mean nobody has it. Every match already carries its phones and emails, so `get` is only for addresses, birthday, job title and URLs. Matches come in the address book's order, not best first: **when several people match, or one person has several numbers, show them and ask — never pick**, least of all right before sending something. Notes and pictures are never returned. An `id` is for the next call, not for keeping: it can change when they merge cards |
| `compose` | Open Apple's own email or text-message sheet, prefilled, for the user to send | **You never send — they do.** The call waits until they tap Send, keep a draft or cancel, and the result says which (`sent` / `saved` / `cancelled`). Only `sent` means sent, and even that means handed to Mail or Messages, not delivered. Look addresses and numbers up with `contacts` first; never guess one. `mail` needs an account in Apple's Mail app and is refused without one; `message` is refused where the device cannot text |
| `files` | Ask the user for a file from their Files app (iCloud Drive, On My iPhone, any provider), or hand them a file you made | You cannot browse their files: `pick` opens the system picker and you get only what they tap, as a **copy** at the path returned (`~/.ios/files/…`). Editing it does not touch their original — `export` the result when they want it back, and they choose where it goes. The call waits for them. Closing the picker is a normal answer (`cancelled` / `saved: false`): say so, do not reopen it on your own. `types` takes type identifiers (`public.image`, `com.adobe.pdf`) or extensions (`pdf`); a string iOS does not recognise is refused, so when unsure leave it out |
| `music` | Search their own music library (songs, albums, artists, playlists), start one playing in the Music app, pause, skip, and say what is playing | **Their library only, not the Apple Music catalogue** — a song they never added cannot be found or played, so never promise "any song"; when `search` comes back empty, say it is not in their library. `play` takes ids, not names: `search` or `playlists` first, then pass the id back as the string it came as. `search` returns every match in library order, not best first — when several match, say which you picked or ask. `play` replaces their queue in Music and keeps going after this app closes. A `cloud` song needs a connection. After `next`/`previous`, call `now` to see what is playing |
| `weather` | Current conditions, an hourly forecast (up to 240 h) and a daily forecast (up to 10 days) for a coordinate, from Apple Weather | No permission and it never reads where the user is: **every call takes `latitude`/`longitude`, not a place name**. "Here" means `location current` first; a named place means `location geocode` or `maps search`, then pick the result. Units are fixed — °C, km/h, hPa, km, mm; humidity, cloud cover and precipitation chance are 0–1. **All times are UTC**, not local to the place: convert before saying an hour, and expect a `daily` date to read one day early east of Greenwich (it is that day's local midnight written in UTC). No alerts, no minute-by-minute rain, no past weather. Keep the final `Weather data: …` line when you relay a forecast — Apple's licence requires the credit. If it says weather is not enabled for this build, do not retry; tell the user it is not available in this version |

These only exist inside the app. They are absent on a development machine, so do not write a plugin that assumes them without checking.

**Writes.** Each capability has a write setting the user controls, under Device capabilities in the app's sidebar. By default a write just happens — do not announce a confirmation that is not coming, and do not ask them in chat first unless the request is genuinely ambiguous. If they have set it to ask every time, the write stops at a system sheet instead and they may refuse; if they have set it to not allowed, it is refused outright with a message saying so.

**Never report a write as done without looking at the result**, whichever setting is in force: the result carries `saved` / `deleted`. A refusal is a perfectly normal outcome, not an error to retry — say what they chose and move on.

**They can see every write afterwards**, under Device capabilities → Activity, with what changed and which caller asked. So a write is on the record even when nothing stopped to ask — which is a reason to be accurate about what you did, not a reason to be casual about it. Deleting is the one to slow down on: say which event you are about to delete before you do it, in the same turn, so a wrong one is caught by them reading rather than by them discovering it later.

**`notify` or `reminders`?** `notify` is this app's own alert: it fires once, leaves nothing behind, and needs no confirmation, so it is the right answer to "remind me in twenty minutes". A reminder is a row in their Reminders app that syncs to their other devices and may live in a list they share with someone — that is their data, so it asks first. Reach for `notify` when the point is to be nudged, and `reminders` when the point is for the thing to be on their list.

**A capability that needs permission starts switched off, and nothing you do turns it on.** Calling it does not raise a system prompt — it comes back refused, with a message saying the user can switch it on under Device capabilities in the app's sidebar. Relay that and stop; retrying is pointless and so is apologising for it. Only the user can grant it, from that screen, and iOS asks once per app for the life of the install.

So "I can't read your calendar" is almost never a limitation worth lamenting: it is one switch away, and the refusal message says where. Tell them where, and offer to carry on once they have flipped it.

If the user already declined the system prompt, the refusal instead says where in Settings to turn it on — same rule, relay it. Calendar has a second trap: iOS 17 offers "Full Access" and "Add Only", and **Add Only cannot read**, so a user who picked it will get a refusal that is worth explaining rather than treating as an empty calendar. Adding an event still works on that tier.

**Changing a repeating event changes that one occurrence**, not the series. If they want the whole series moved, say that you can only move this one.

**A limited selection is not their address book.** On iOS 18 and later the user can share just a few contacts with the app. The reply then says `access: "limited"` and opens with a note. In that state "no match" means "not among the ones you shared with me" — never tell them a person is not in their contacts. Say what you can see, and that they can change the selection in Settings > Privacy & Security > Contacts.

**`compose` or `open_url`?** A `mailto:` or `sms:` link leaves the app and you never learn what happened next. `compose` stays in the app, carries attachments, and tells you whether they sent, saved or cancelled — so prefer it, say "I've opened a draft for you to send", and report the result as it came back. A cancel is them changing their mind, not something to retry. When `mail` is refused because Apple's Mail has no account, give them the text, or offer a `mailto:` Markdown link (it opens whichever mail app they made the default) and say that you cannot tell whether they send it.

**`files` is how anything outside the workspace gets in or out.** The shell sees only the engine's own filesystem, so "the PDF in my iCloud Drive" is not at any path you can `ls` — ask for it with `files pick`. There is no way to be given a folder to work in directly: files are copied in and copied out, one explicit step each. If `pick` returns a `failed` list, those files did not arrive; name them to the user rather than carrying on with the ones that did.

`music` results say what happened with `played` / `paused` / `skipped` rather than `saved`; the rule under **Writes** is the same — read it before saying the music started. A `play` that fails after about 20 seconds with "did not report the queue ready" has usually hit songs that are not downloaded with no connection: say so rather than retrying.

**Not built:** listening to the microphone, the Apple Music catalogue, writing to Health, adding or editing contacts, sending a mail or message without the user tapping Send, and working in a folder outside the workspace. Say so plainly rather than trying a way round.

## Not possible at all

Tell the user plainly rather than attempting these: compiling native code, running containers or virtual machines, starting system services, background daemons that outlive the app, controlling other apps, or anything needing root. Work that needs them belongs on another machine.

The device capabilities above are the exception to "controlling other apps": they are system frameworks the app is allowed to use, not other apps being driven.
