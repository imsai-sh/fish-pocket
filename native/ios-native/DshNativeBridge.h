// How a capability asks the app to put something in front of the user.
//
// Writes are the reason this exists. The system grant that lets us read a
// calendar lets us write it too (§4.0), so "the agent can see my schedule but
// will not quietly change it" is ours to guarantee, not iOS's. The guarantee is
// this: every write stops here, on the main thread, in front of the user, and
// **the decision never leaves the native side**. A plugin cannot intercept it,
// replay it, or carry on without it, because nothing about it crosses into JS
// (docs/native-services.md §4.3).
//
// That is also why this is a protocol the ObjC side owns rather than an import
// of Swift's generated header: the capability depends on a contract, not on the
// app's build products, and the app registers an implementation at launch.
